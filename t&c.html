          <h5>Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.</h5>

          </h5>
          <h3>6. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h3>
          <h5>As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with an True Alpha product or service violates your copyright, please notify us in accordance with True Alpha’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of True Alpha or others. In the case of such termination, we will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.</h5>
          <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
          <h5>The Agreement does not transfer from True Alpha to you any True Alpha or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with True Alpha. True Alpha and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with True Alpha and our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of True Alpha or True Alpha’s licensors.

          <h3>8. Third-Party Services</h3>
          <h5>In using the Services, you may enable or use services, products, software (like themes or plugins), embeds, or applications developed by a third party or yourself (“Third Party Services”) on your website. If you use any Third-Party Services, you understand that:
              <li>•	Third Party Services are not vetted, endorsed, or controlled by True Alpha.</li>
              <li>•	Any use of a Third-Party Service is at your own risk, and we shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for Third Party Services.</li>
              <li>•	Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and will be governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review the Third Party’s terms and policies before using a Third-Party Service.</li>
              <li>•	Some Third-Party Services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data, for example, via a pixel or cookie. If you use the Third-Party Service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices. We do not have control over how a Third-Party Service may use your data. You should carefully review Third Party Services’ data collection, retention, and use policies and practices before enabling Third Party Services.</li>
              <li>•	Third Party Services may not work appropriately with your website, and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by any Third-Party Services.</li>
              <li>•	If you have questions or concerns about how a Third-Party Service operates, or need support, please contact the Third Party directly.</li>
              In rare cases, we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third Party Services from your account or website.
          </h5>
          <h3>9. Changes</h3>
          <h5>We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of True Alpha, or by the posting by True Alpha of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.</h5>
          <h3>10. Termination</h3>
          <h5>We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any True Alpha policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict the resources your website uses, or terminate your Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth usage is out of hand and/or burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</h5>
          <h5>All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</h5>
          <h3>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
          <h5></h5>
          <h3>12. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.</h3>
          <h5>Our Services are provided “as is.” True Alpha and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither True Alpha, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. If you’re actually reading this, here’s a treat. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.</h5>
          <h3>13. Arbitration Agreement</h3>
          <h5>Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under the Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce the Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees.</h5>
          <h3>14. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <h5>In no event will True Alpha, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to True Alpha under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. True Alpha shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</h5>
          <h3>15. Indemnification</h3>
          <h5>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless True Alpha, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.</h5>
          <h3>16. US Economic Sanctions</h3>
          <h5>You expressly represent and warrant that your use of our Services and/or associated services and products is not contrary to applicable U.S. Sanctions.

          <h3>17. Data Processing Agreement</h3>
          <h5>If you need a Data Processing Agreement with us for the GDPR requirements that apply to us as a data processor for your website, please follow these instructions.</h5>
          <h3>18. Translation</h3>
          <h5>These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.</h5>
          <h3>19. Miscellaneous</h3>
          <h5>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between True Alpha and you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; True Alpha may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</h5>
